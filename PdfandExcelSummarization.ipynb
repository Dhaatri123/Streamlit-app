Antilock braking system (ABS) prevent  brakes from locking \n","during braking. In normal  braking situation the driver control the brakes,  however during severs \n","braking or on slippery  roadways when driver the wheels to  approach lockup, the antilock takes \n","over here. The ABS modulates the brake line  pressure independent of the pedal force to  bring the \n","wheel speed back to the slip level  range that necessary to the optimal braking  performance. The \n","ABS does not allow full  wheel lock under braking.  In simple terms, during emergency of  braking, \n","the wheel does not get locked even  if you push a full auto brake pedal and hence  the skidding does \n","not takes place. It allowed  driver to control the car easier, even on roads  with low adhesion, such \n","a rain, snow and  muddy road.  \n","The brain of antilock braking  system consist Electronic Control Unit (ECU),  wheel speed sensor \n","and hydraulic modulator.  ABS is a closed circuit, hence it used the  feedback control system that \n","modulates the  brake pressure in response to the wheel  deceleratio n and wheel angular velocity to \n","prevent the controlled wheel from locking.  \n","SUBSYSTEM OF ANTILOCK  BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) : Lecture Notes: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  (18ECE823)                        \n"," \n","Dr. Vinaykumar R, Assistant Professor, ECE, NMIT, Bengaluru  2 \n"," 1. Wheel -Speed Sensors : Each of the ABS wheel speed sensors  detects the speed of the \n","corresponding  wheel. The sensor consists of a permanent  magnet, coil and tone wheel. The \n","magnetic  flux produced by the permanent magnet  changes as each tooth of the tone wheel  (which \n","rotates together with the wheel)  passes in front of the magnet’s pole piece.  The changing magnetic \n","flux induces voltages  at a frequency corresponding to the wheel  speed.  \n","2. Electronic Control Unit (ECU) : The work of ECU is to receive, amplifies and  filter the sensor \n","signals for calculating the  speed rotation and acceleration of the  vehicle. ECU also uses the speeds \n","of two  diagonally opposite wheels to calculate an  estimate for the speed of the vehicle. The  slip of \n","each wheel is obtain by comparing the  reference speed with the individual wheel.  \n","During wheel slip or wheel acceleration  condition signal server to alert the ECU. The  \n","microcomputer alert by sending the trigger  the pressure control valve of the solenoids  of the \n","pressure modulator to modulate the  brake pressure in the individual wheel brake  cylinders.  The \n","ECU reacts to a recognized defect or  error by switch ing off the malfunctioning part of the system \n","or shutting down the entire ABS.  \n","3. Hydraulic Pressure Modulator/  Hydraulic Control Unit : The Hydraulic pressure modulator \n","is an  electro -hydraulic device for reducing, restoring  and holdi ng the pressure of the wheel by \n","manipulating the solenoid valve in the hydraulic  brake system. ABS hydraulic modulator  unit \n","contain the valve, solenoid and piston.  Under hard braking condition, this assembly  control the \n","holding and release of the different  hydraulic brake circuit. During the normal  condition the \n","standard braking system  used.  \n","Whenever hard braking situation occur, the  system sense the change in the rotation of  the speed \n","sensor and decide whether to hold  or release pressure to a brake circuit. A tire  has its best traction \n","just before it begin to  skid, once it begins to skid a portion of traction  and steering will be lost.  \n","ANTI -LOCK BRAKE TYPE  \n","Different schemes of anti -lock braking system  uses depending upon the types of brakes  use. \n","Depending upon the channel (valve) and  number of speed sensors the antilock brake  are classified.  \n","1. Four Channel, Four Sensor ABS :  It is a more preferable type, the speed sensor  on all the four \n","wheels and contain separate  valve for all four wheels. By using this setup,  the controller monitors \n","each wheel  individually to make sure it is achieving  maximum braking force.  \n","2. Three Channel, Three Sensor ABS : This type of system is can be found  commonly in the \n","pickup trucks with four wheel  ABS, on each of the front wheels there is a  valve and a speed sensor, Lecture Notes: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  (18ECE823)                        \n"," \n","Dr. Vinaykumar R, Assistant Professor, ECE, NMIT, Bengaluru  3 \n"," and one valve and  one sensor for both rear wheels. The speed  sensor for rear wheels is located in \n","the rear  axle.  To achieve the maximum braking force,  this system provides individual control to \n","the front wheels. The rear wheels, however, are  controlled togeth er; they are both have to start to \n","lock up before the ABS will active on the  rear. With the help of this system, it's possible  that one \n","if the rear wheels will lock during a  stop, reducing brake effectiveness.  \n","3. One Channel, One Sensor ABS : This Arrangement can be seen in a pickup  trucks and heavy \n","trucks with rear wheel ABS.  It consist one valve, which operate both rear  wheel, and one speed \n","sensor located in the  rear axle. This is quite similar as the rear end  of a three channel system. The \n","rear wheel  are monitored together and they both have  to lockup before ABS starts its action. In \n","this system there is also probability that one of  the rear wheels will lock, results reducing in  brake \n","effectiveness. This system is easy to  identify, usually there will be one brake line  going through a \n","T-fitting to both rear wheels.  \n","IMPORTANTCE OF ABS  \n","1. Stopping Distance : The Stopping distance is a one of the  important factor when it comes for \n","braking.  Stopping distance is the function of vehicle  mass, its initial velocity and the braking force.  \n","Stopping distance can be minimize by  increasing in braking force (keeping all other  factors \n","constant). In all types of road surface  there is always exists a peak in friction  coefficient. An \n","antilock system can attain  maximum fictional force and results minimum  stopping distance. This \n","objective of antilock  system s however, is tempered by the need  for vehicle stability and \n","steerability.   \n","2. Stability : The fundamental purpose of braking system  is to decelerating and stopping of vehicle,  \n","maximum friction force may not be described  in some cases like asphalt and ice (p -split)  surface, \n","such that significantly more braking  force is obtainable on one side of the vehicle  than on the other \n","side. So when applying full  brake on both the sides will result yaw or  skidding moment that will \n","tend to pull the  vehicle to the high friction side and results  vehicle instability. Here comes the \n","concept  of antilock system that maintain the slip both  rear wheels at the same level and minimize  \n","two friction coefficient peaks, then lateral  force i s reasonably high thought not  maximized. This \n","contributes to stability and  is an objective of antilock systems.  \n","3. Steerability : Good peak frictional force control is  necessary in order to achieve satisfactory  \n","lateral forces and, therefore, satisfactory  steerability. Steerability while braking is  important not \n","only for minor course  corrections but also for the possibility of  steering around an obstacle. Tire  Lecture Notes: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  (18ECE823)                        \n"," \n","Dr. Vinaykumar R, Assistant Professor, ECE, NMIT, Bengaluru  4 \n"," characteristics play an important role in the  braking and steering response of a vehicle.  For ABS -\n","equipped vehicles the tire  performance is of critical significance. All  braking and steering forces \n","must be  generated within the small tire contact patch  between the vehicle and the road. Tire  traction \n","forces as well as side forces can only  be produced when a difference exists  between the speed of \n","the tire circumference  and the speed of the vehicle relative to the  road surface. This difference is \n","denoted as  slip. It is common to relate the tire braking  force to the tire braking slip.  After the peak \n","value has been reached,  increased tire slip causes reduction of tire  road friction coefficient. ABS \n","has to limit the  slip to values below the peak value to prevent  wheel from locking. Tires with a \n","high peak  friction point achieve maximum friction at 10  to 20% slip. The optimum slip value  \n","decreases as tire -road friction decreases.  \n"," \n","TCS : Traction  refers to the maximum frictional force that can be produced between surfaces \n","without slipping. In auto mobiles traction is responsible for the movement of vehicle. In the design \n","of wheeled or tracked vehicles, high traction between wheel and ground is mor e desirable than low \n","traction, as it allows for more energetic acceleration without wheel slippage.  Traction control is a \n","technology designed to help your vehicle maintain traction, no matter how slippery the road \n","surface. Technically, it is a mechanical, hydraulic, or electric system that maintains or controls \n","traction to any wheels driven by the engine. Unlike mechanical traction control systems of the past \n","such as limited slip differentials, today’s systems are nearly all computer -controlled as they \n","actively watch wheel slip. An option formerly reserved for performance, you can find traction \n","control on all types of vehicles today.   \n","The purpose of the Traction Control System is to prevent wheel spin from occurring due to \n","acceleration. The maximum torque that can be  transmitted to the wheels is determined by the \n","coefficient of friction  generated between the road and the tires. If torque exceeds that level,  the \n","wheels are likely to spin. Conditions for Traction operation may  include slippery road surfaces, \n","acceleration while  cornering and hard acceleration.  The basic idea behind the need of a traction \n","control system is the difference between the slips of different wheels or an apparent loss of road \n","grip that may result in loss of steering control over the vehicle which leads to slipping of the vehicle \n","and los s of power which results in uncontrolled cruising. Difference in slip may occur due to \n","turning of a vehicle or differently varying road conditions for different wheels. And thus need to \n","be contr olled for a safer way to cruise.

The processing part consists \n","of an Anti -lock Braking System (ABS) or a TRAC Electronic Control Unit (TRAC ECU) and an \n","Lecture Notes: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  (18ECE823)                        \n"," \n","Dr. Vinaykumar R, Assistant Professor, ECE, NMIT, Bengaluru  6 \n"," Engine Control Modulator (ECM).

The control action can consist \n","of one or more actions such as redu cing or suppress the spark to one or more cylinders, reducing \n","fuel supply to one or more cylinders, brake one or more wheels, close the throttle where vehicle is \n","fitted with ECM controlled throttle, and the boost control solenoid can be actuated to reduce boost \n","and therefore engine power. The controlled action of the one or more of the above outputs can help \n","in traction control of the vehicle resulting in a slip proof cruising of the vehicle irrespective of the \n","external weather conditions.  \n","WHAT IS ESP IN A CAR?  \n","Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) is a computerized safety  technology present in most modern \n","cars. It is designed to improve a  vehicle’s stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction, thus \n","preventing the tyres from skidding uncontrollably. When the stability  control programme detects \n","a loss of steering control, it automatically  applies individual brakes to help ‘stee r’ the vehicle where \n","the driver intended it to go.  \n","The ESP system fitted to the majority of modern cars is manufactured by  Bosch. Car manufacturers \n","then fine-tune the standard settings to best  suit the handling properties and sporting credentials of \n","their particular  cars. Many car manufacturers have also adapted and created their own  versions of \n","ESP. \n","Electronic Stability Control (ESC) are actually one and the same; the  differences in their name \n","resulting from the vehicle manufacturer you  choose to buy from. Other, branded, stability control \n","systems are  variously named “DSC” (i.e. Aston Martin, BMW & Jaguar), “MSP”  (Maserati), \n","“PSM” (Porsche), “CST” (previous generation Ferrari) and many  more.  \n","HOW DOES ESP WORK?  Lecture Notes: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  (18ECE823)                        \n"," \n","Dr. Vinaykumar R, Assistant Professor, ECE, NMIT, Bengaluru  7 \n"," ESP operates in conjunction with the Anti -lock Braking System (ABS)  and Traction Control \n","System (TCS). ABS is of course designed to  maintain traction and enable steering during severe \n","braking by  preventing lockup, whereas TCS helps a vehicle’s drive wheels maintain  traction \n","during acceleration. Put more simply, ABS stops the wheels  from spinning whilst braking and TCS \n","stops the wheels from spinning  whilst accelerating.  \n","ESP operates mostly through the ABS, but also relies on TCS to detect  subtle differences between \n","the driver’s control inputs and the actual  response of the vehicle.  The purpose of ESP is to \n","constantly monitor steering wheel angle in  relation to the actual direction of travel; measuring \n","individual wheel  speed, yaw angle and steering angle 25 times per second. In doing so,  ESP helps \n","compensate for driver errors that would otherwise affect  lateral dynamics; whereas ABS and \n","traction control systems do the same  for longitudinal dynamics.  \n","If the car loses lateral traction, and either the front or rear starts to slide  sideways, ESP reacts by \n","mitigating the cause of the skid; reducing  power when appropriate, and applying individual brakes \n","as required to  help force the car to follow the steering angle. In the event of  understeer , ESP \n","applies the brake to the inside rear wheel to help the  car rotate more, whereas if oversteer is the \n","issue ESP triggers the  outside front wheel brake to create a more helpful pivot point to bring  the \n","rear of the car  back under control.  \n","ESP WARNING LIGHT  \n","When a car is in motion and the ESP warning light comes on, it will show  in 1 of 2 ways:  \n","➢ Steady illumination  \n","➢ Flashing  \n","STEADY ILLUMINATED ESP LIGHT  \n","Steady illumination of the ESP/ESC warning light (typically a symbol  depicting a car with lurid \n","skid lines behind it) indicates that the system is  inoperative. Either it has been switched off \n","deliberately (by the driver, or  passenger!), or it may have failed for some reason; most usually a  \n","temporary fault, caused by a sensor overheating (in which case, allow  things to cool down, then \n","‘reboot’ the system by switching off the  ignition, pausing a little while, then re -starting the engine).  \n","It’s worth noting at this point that some cars automatically either  partially or fully disable ESP \n","when certain driving modes are selected.  \n","By default, ESP is always ‘on’ and ready to assist the driver every time the  engine is started. This \n","way, we cannot commence a new journey having  forgotten to re -engage ESP.

When the car  detects at least one of the wheels starting to slip, the \n","ESP kicks in to  help you recover your intended path and the light brie fly flashes to  indicate it has \n","done so. This may be interpreted as a warning to drive  with greater finesse, and/or with more \n","attention to grip levels (it stands  to reason that ESP triggers readily when driving in extreme \n","conditions  such as  mud, ice or snow ). \n"," \n","Passive Safety Systems:   \n","Airbag systems : It works on the principle of newton’s law of motion  i.e, “Things that are moving \n","tend to keep on moving until something (a force of some kind) stops them”.  \n"," Anything that has mass and velocity has kinetic energy . \n"," Heavier your car and the faster you're going, the more kinetic energy it has.  \n"," Though cars are designed to crumple up and absorb impacts, their energy still poses a major \n","risk to the driver and passengers.  \n","Evolution of AIRBAG System:  \n"," People inside a moving car have mass and velocity too and, even if the car stops, they'll \n","tend to keep on going.  \n"," The seatbelt of car restrain only body. Head isn't restrained at all.  \n"," So even if body is fastened tight, the same basic law of physics says your head will keep \n","on going and smash into the steering wheel or the glass  windshield (windscreen). That's \n","where airbags come in.  \n","There are three main parts of airbag System:  \n","1. Bag \n","2. Sensors  \n","3. Inflation System  \n","➢ The bag is comprising of a thin nylon fabric, which is folded and placed into the \n","steering wheel or dashboard or, more recently, into the seat or door.

When a car hits something, it starts to decelerate (lose speed) very rapidly.  \n","2. An accelerometer  (electronic chip that measures acceleration or force) detects the change \n","of speed.  \n","3. If the deceleration is great enough, the accelerometer triggers the airbag circuit . Normal \n","braking  doesn't generate enough force to do this.  \n","4. The airbag circuit passes an electric current through a heating element . \n","5. The heating element ignites a chemical explosive . Older airbags used sodium azide as their \n","explosive; newer ones use different chemicals.  \n","Lecture Notes: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  (18ECE823)                        \n"," \n","Dr. Vinaykumar R, Assistant Professor, ECE, NMIT, Bengaluru  10 \n"," 6. As the explosive burns, it generates a massive amount of harmless gas (typically either \n","nitrogen or argon) that floods into a nylon  bag packed behind the steering wheel.  \n","7.

In this phase, the system is analyzed to identify hazards and potential failure modes.  \n","• Design and Implementation.

System or category  \n","The first le tter in the code, which in this case is P, represents the system or category of the DTC. \n","It pinpoints the related  system.  \n","The OBD -II diagnostic trouble codes are categorized into four di fferent systems or categories:  \n","➢ B-codes refer to the body. This category covers parts that are mainly found in the passenger \n","compartment area and is mainly concerned with driver -related functions, such as safety \n","and convenience.  \n","➢ C-codes refer to the chassis category, which deals with areas outside the passenger \n","compartment. It covers functionalities, such as brakes , suspension, steering, and \n","mechanical systems.  \n","➢ P-codes refer to the powertrain category. This category covers functions that include \n","transmission, engine, and associated drivetrain accessories.  \n","➢ U-codes refer to network and vehicle integration and cover functions managed by the on -\n","board computer system.  \n","As in our example (P 0430 ), the DTC code starts with P, we know that the vehicle issue is related \n","to the powertrain  system.  \n","2. Generic and manufacturer specific codes  \n","The second number in the DTC represents either a generic or manufacturer specific code. \n","Generally, you will see DTCs  starting with either a 0 or 1.  \n","DTCs that start with 0 as the first digit a fter the le tter that represents the system refer to generic \n","codes. In other words,  0 refers to generic faults. It represents a generic code that is followed by all \n","OBD -II vehicles.  On the other hand, codes starting with 1 are manufacturer specific codes. These \n","codes are unique to the specific model  of the vehicle.  \n","In our example of P 0430 , the first number is 0, which means it is a generic code.  \n","3. Subsystems  \n","The third character (number) in the diagnostic trouble code indicates the subsystem in which the \n","fault is.  The powertrain category (P) has eight subsystems:  \n","• 0 – Fuel and air metering and auxiliary emission controls  \n","• 1 – Fuel and air metering  Lecture Notes: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  (18ECE823)                        \n"," \n","Dr. Vinaykumar R, Assistant Professor, ECE, NMIT, Bengaluru  24 \n"," • 2 – Fuel and air metering – injector circuit  \n","• 3 – Ignition systems  \n","• 4 – Auxiliary emission controls  \n","• 5 – Vehicle speed control and engine idling  \n","• 6 – Computer and auxiliary outputs  \n","• 7 – Transmission  \n","Sometimes, you may also see a le tter (A, B, or C) instead of a number in the DTC. In that case, \n","these three le tters refer to  the hybrid propulsion systems.  In our  example, the third character \n","(P0430 ) represents an issue with auxiliary emission controls.  \n","4. Fault code description  \n","The last two numbers (sometimes, three) in the DTC refer to the actual fault description. It can be \n","any number between  0 to 99.  In our example (P 0430 ), it is 30, which indicates that the catalyst \n","system e fficiency is below the threshold. There could  be multiple reasons for that, e.g., a faulty \n","catalytic converter, engine mechanical damage, exhaust leak, or a leaking fuel  injector.  \n","Another Example of DTC:  \n"," \n","

Active Safety Systems: ABS, TCS, ESP, Brake assist etc. Airbag systems, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) Autonomous vehicles. Lane Departure Warning, Collision Warning, Automatic Cruise Control, Headlights Control, Connected Cars technology and trends towards autonomous vehicles. Antilock Breaking System (ABS) is used in advanced automobiles to prevent slip and locking of wheel after brakes applied. In normal  braking situation the driver control the brakes, but during severs braking or on slippery  roadways when driver the wheels to  approach loc. The ABS modulates the brake line  pressure independent of the pedal force. It allowed  driver to control the car easier, even on roads  with low traffic. The brain of antilock braking  system consist Electronic Control Unit (ECU),  wheel speed sensor  and hydraulic modulator. ABS is a closed circuit, hence it used the  feedback control system that modulates the  brake pressure in response to the wheel  deceleratio n and wheel angular velocity. Each of the ABS wheel speed sensors detects the speed of the corresponding wheel. The sensor consists of a permanent  magnet, coil and tone wheel. The work of ECU is to receive, amplifies and  filter the sensor signals for calculating the speed rotation and acceleration of the vehicle. ECU also uses the speeds of two diagonally opposite wheels to calculate an  estimate for the speed of the car. The ABS reacts to a recognized defect or error by switch ing off the malfunctioning part of the system or shutting down the entire ABS. The hydraulic pressure modulator is an electro -hydraulic device for reducing, restoring  and holdi ng the pressure of the wheel. ABS hydraulic modulator unit contain the valve, solenoid and piston. Under hard braking condition, this assembly control the holding and release of the different hydraulic brake circuit. AntI -lock braking system uses depending upon the types of brakes  use. Depending upon the channel (valve) and  number of speed sensors the antilock brake are classified. Three Channel, Three Sensor ABS : This type of system is can be found  commonly in the pickup trucks with four wheel  ABS, on each of the front wheels there is a valve and a speed sensor. The controller monitors  each wheel individually to make sure it is achieving  maximum braking force. The ABS system provides individual control to the front wheels. The rear wheels, however, are  controlled togeth er. This arrangement can be seen in a pickup  trucks and heavy  vehicles. The rear wheel ABS system is similar to the rear end of a three channel system. The rear wheel  are monitored together and they both have  to lockup before ABS starts its action. Stopping distance is the function of vehicle  mass, its initial velocity and the braking force. In all types of road surface  there is always exists a peak in friction  coefficient. An antilock system can attain  maximum fictional force and stopping distance. The fundamental purpose of braking system  is to decelerating and stopping of vehicle. This objective of antilock  system s however, is tempered by the need  for vehicle stability and steerability. So when applying full  brake on both the si Antilock system that maintain the slip both  rear wheels at the same level and minimize   two friction coefficient peaks. If lateral  force i s reasonably high thought not  maximized. des will result yaw or  skidding moment. Steerability while braking is important not only for minor course corrections but also for the possibility of  steering around an obstacle. For ABS -equipped vehicles the tire  performance is of satisfactory quality. All  braking and steering forces must be generated within the small tire contact patch between the vehicle and the road. Tire  traction forces as well as side forces can only  be produced when a difference exists between the speed of the tire circumference and the speed  of the vehicle relative to the road surface. Tires with a high peak  friction point achieve maximum friction at 10  to 20% slip. The optimum slip value  decreases as tire -road friction decreases. High traction between wheel and ground is mor e desirable than low. High traction allows for more energetic acceleration without wheel slippage. Traction control is a mechanical, hydraulic, or electric system. The purpose of the Traction Control System is to prevent wheel spin from occurring due to acceleration. The maximum torque that can be  transmitted to the wheels is determined by the coefficient of friction generated between the road and the tires. The basic idea behind the need of a traction control system is the difference between the slips of different wheels. Conditions for Traction operation may  include slippery road surfaces, acceleration while  cornering and hard acceleration. A simple input output process block diagram is given in figure 1 and various inputs are shown on the left side. The process control unit is represented in the middle part if the figure. The main inputs for a TRAC system are wheel speed sensors, battery level sensor, TRAC OFF switch, stop light switch, and the throttle position sensor. These inputs give speed signal, remaining battery signal, OFF signal, stop signal an d throttle level signal respectively. The processing part consists of an Anti -lock Braking System (ABS) or TRAC Electronic Control Unit (TRAC ECU) The TRAC ECU will have an interconnection with ECM in order to communicate to the engine throttle position control. These processing units process and  analyze the input signals and take necessary output actions if required. The control action can consist of one or more actions such as redu cing or suppress the spark to one or several cylinders, reducing fuel supply, and brake one or two wheels. Vehicle is fitted with ECM controlled throttle, and the boost control solenoid can be actuated to reduce boost and therefore engine power. Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) is a computerized safety technology present in most modern cars. It is designed to improve a  vehicle’s stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction, thus preventing the tyres from skidding. The ESP system fitted to the majority of modern cars is manufactured by Bosch. Car manufacturers can fine-tune the standard settings to best suit the handling properties and sporting credentials of their particular cars.  ESP operates in conjunction with the Anti -lock Braking System (ABS) and Traction Control System (TCS) Other, branded, stability control systems are  variously named “DSC” (i.e. Aston Martin, BMW & Jaguar) ESP operates mostly through the ABS, but also relies on TCS to detect subtle differences between driver’s control inputs and the actual response of the vehicle. The purpose of ESP is to constantly monitor s. ntain traction and enable steering during severe braking.  ESP measures individual wheel speed, yaw angle and steering angle 25 times per second. In doing so,  ESP helps  compensate for driver errors that would otherwise affect lateral dynamics.  ESP applies the brake to the inside rear wheel to help the  car rotate more. If oversteer is the  issue ESP triggers the  outside front wheel brake. Steady illumination of the ESP/ESC warning light indicates that the system is inoperative. Either it has been switched off deliberately (by the driver, or  passenger!), or it may have failed for some reason. Most usually a  temporary fault, caused by a sensor overheating. By default, ESP is always ‘on’ and ready to assist the driver every time the engine is started. Some cars automatically either  partially or fully disable ESP when certain driving modes are selected. If the ESP momentarily flashes whilst the vehicle is in motion, it is an  indication that the traction control system is intervening. ESP warning light stay on, even after an extended cool-down/reset period. A visit to your dealer or marque specialist is required to diagnose and fix the problem.  ESP triggers readily when driving in extreme conditions such as mud, ice or snow. It works on the principle of newton’s law of motion. The light brie fly flashes to indicate it has done so. Heavier your car and the faster you're going, the more kinetic energy it has. People inside a moving car have mass and velocity too and, even if the car stops, they'll keep on going. There are three main parts of airbag System: Bag, Sensors and Inflation System. The bag is comprising of a thin nylon fabric, which is folded and placed into the steering wheel or dashboard or, more recently, into the seat or door. Sensor is the alerting device that gives the signal to the bag to inflate. Inflation process tends to happen when there is a n equivalent collision force. A small mechanical switch is turned on when the required mass force is detected. NaN 3 (sodium azide) chemically reacts with KNO 3(Potassium nitrate) to yield nitrogen gas. When a car hits something, it starts to decelerate (lose speed) very rapidly. If the deceleration is great enough, the accelerometer triggers the airbag circuit. Electric current through a heating element ignites a chemical explosive. As the explosive burns, it generates a massive amount of harmless gas. This gas floods into a nylon bag packed behind the steering wheel. As the bag expands, it blows the plastic cover off the steering wheel. The driver (moving forward because of the impact) pushes against the bag. This makes the bag deflate as the gas it contains escapes through small holes around its edges. ADAS were first being used in the 1950s with the adoption of the anti -lock braking system. DAS can warn drivers of potential dangers, intervene to help the driver remain in control in order to prevent an accident. An automotive night vision system is used to increase a vehicle driver’s perception and  seeing distance in darkness or poor weather. The first car night visionsystem was implemented on the Cadillac 2000 DeVille, which  used infrared technology to detect pedestrians. Automotive night vision works on two principle: Active illumination and Thermal imaging. It works on the principle of coupling imaging intensification with an active source in the near infrared (NIR) band. Active infrared night vision combines infrared illumination in spectral range 0.7 –1 μm. The  scene, which appears dark to a human observer now appears as a monochrome image on a normal display device. A special lens focuses the infrared light emitted by all of the objects in view. The focused light is scanned by a phased array of infrared -detector elements. The detector elements create a very detailed temperature pattern. LDWS is a lane tracking system that helps alert drivers when they unintentionally drift out of their intended lane. Around 40% -60% of the total traffic accident causalities are due to abnormal lane changing. Unintentional lane departure can be caused by driver distraction, drowsiness, or even adverse weather conditions. It uses various sensors, mainly a camera to detect lane markings ahead of the vehicle. If the vehicle is threatening to stray outside the limits of the lane, the system alerts the driver. Lecture Notes: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS (18ECE823) Dr. Vinaykumar R, Assistant Professor, ECE, NMIT, Bengaluru. The car senses you have your hands at least lightly on the steering wheel, and as long as the curves aren't too sharp. It automatically takes steps to ensure  the vehicle stays in its lane. Some cars beeps when the car crosses a solid or dotted lane marking. Cars vibrate the steering wheel or seat cushion to direct attention to the left or right side. Ultrasonic works by sending out pulses of sound and sensing how long these  take to be reflected from an object. This sensor technology also has no problem operating in fog and darkness. Cameras offer the advantage that they operate with a very high resolution. Radar sensors of this kind are fitted as corner radars in the ends of the bumpers. Long -range and full-range radar sensors, on the other hand, cover longer distances (up to 250 meters) LIDAR - Like radar, lidar is also an acronym. It stands for light detection and ranging. Lidar sends horizontally and vertically diffracted light pulses out into its surroundings. This scanning  allows distances to be measured, taking fixed and moving objects into account. The lidar sensor makes it  possible to create a 3D map of the immediate area.  ISO 26262 mandates a functional safety development process that automotive OEMs and suppliers must follow. It outlines a risk classification system (Automotive Safety Integrity  Levels, or ASILs)  ISO 26262 provides a process for managing and reducing risks as sociated with electrical and/or electronic systems. It is based on the concept of a safety life cycle, which includes the following phases. The system is analyzed to identify hazards and potential failure modes. requirements for the system ar e defined, and a safety plan is developed. In this phase, the system is designed and implemented to meet the requirements.  ISO 26262 also specifies the documentation that must be produced and the tools that can be used. The system is tested in its intende d environment to ensure that it behaves as expected. In this phase, the safety requirements are maintained.  ISO 26262’s Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) are based on  three variables: severity, probability of exposure, and controllability by the driver. Guidance was added on model based development, software safety analysis, dependent failure analysis, fault tolerance, and more.  ISO 26262 standard will continue to evolve. Full vehicle autonomy is on the roadmap for the automotive industry. The standard is very detailed and complex. Meeting the requirements of the standard can be time-consuming and costly. It may require significant changes to existing development processes. Ensuring that a system meets the requ irements can be  challenging. There may be a lack of tool support for certain asp ects of the standard. Maintaining traceability of requirements and design decisions can be difficult, especially in large and complex projects. Adopting ISO 26262 helps ensure that the safety of car components is considered from the development process. It provides a comprehensive framework for managing  safety throughout the entire lifecycle of an automotive component. The standard takes into account the trend of increasing integrat ion of hardware and software in automotive electronic systems. It provides detailed guidelines  for concurrent development and testing. ds, preventing costly issues from arising. 18ECE823: Electrical power and control signals must be delivered to electrical devices reliably and safely. The branch circuits making up the individual systems have one wire to co-ordinate. One -WIRE CIRCUIT requires two wires to complete the electrical circuit - one wire from the source of electrical energy to the unit it will operate, and another wire to complete the circuit from the unit back to the source. Two-wire circuit is called a two-wire system and is used to connect the battery and the unit. Two basic types of wiring are as follows: The CABLE ASSEMBLY consists of a stranded conductor with insulation or a combination of insulated conductors enclosed in a covering or jacket from end to end. The Wiring Assembly consists of wires and cables of definitely prescribed length, assembled together  to form a sub-assembly that will interconnect specific electrical components and equipment. Cable assemblies may have two or more ends. They prevent chafing and loosening of terminals and connections caused by vibration and road shock while keeping the wires in a neat condition away from moving parts of vehicle. Wires in the electrical system should be identified by a number, color, or code to  facilitate tracing circuits during assembly, troubleshooting, or rewiring operations. This identification should appear on wiring schematics and diagrams. Wire terminals are divided into two major classes - the solder type and the solder -less type, also known as the pressure or crimp type. The solder type has a  cup in which the wire is held by solder, the solder-less type is connected to the wire by special tools. Wire in the electrical system should be supported by clamps or fastened by wire ties. Wire passing through holes in the metal body should be protected by rubber grommets. Multiplex wiring system allows multiple electronic messages to travel back and forth. Just as broadband cable allows telephone, television and Internet connections to travel through the same line. The multiplex wiring system’s electronic control modules send information back and forth, monitoring vehicle components. Because the modules are remotely controlled by signals, rather than by separate  wires, fewer relays and connectors are required. Onboard computers capture fault data and relay it to the electronic  instrument cluster in the dash. Each wire is colored and numbered for easy identification. Switches can be added or moved quickly without reprogramming by the dealer. The timing light is used to measure and set ignition timing. It is a special stroboscopic light  that generates very short duration light pulses. The probe generates a very short duration voltage pulse each time the sp. s for it to be approved. Both the light p ulse and the ignition time must match to obtain the optimal working of the engine. The ignition timing can be calibrated by altering the timing  marks on the crankshaft pulley. This can be used for checking the ignition timing as well as to adjus t them at the same time. The complexities of automobiles have increased over time hence doing maintenance has become difficult. It is necessary to recognize t. Diagnosis is fault finding, diagnosis determines the type and location of fault that may lead to an error. Symptom: The effect of a fault noticed by the driver, user, or technician. Fault: The root cause of a symptom/problem. Diagnostics: The process. Dr. Vinaykumar R, Assistant Professor, ECE, NMIT, Bengaluru. Lecture Notes: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS (18ECE823) Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) concerns have become more important. Start all hands -on diagnostic routines with ‘hand and eye checks’ A misfire may be caused by a loose plug lead – it is easier to look for this than interpret the  ignition waveforms on a scope. If the ABS warning light stays on – look to  see if the wheel speed sensor(s) are covered in  mud or oil. Malfunctioning Indicator light or MIL i.e when your vehicle indicates the light on for  check engine. diagnostics. Data has mostly related to ECU or Engine and  transmission units. OBD monitors only the emission or engine issues. Off-board is for all the kinds of control units present in the car. This is mostly designed for better  performance. Only an expert can read, delete, fix these kinds of issues in a Car. To perf orm these tests the tester uses certain rigid formats and it is used for the ECU reset, Security Access. Vehicle diagnostics is needed or is important to identify the intrinsic as well as extrinsic  issues. o request the ECU  for data,  to receive the data from ECU, to read the data, and to change, re -write or format the data in the memory of ECU. Uble code is generally divided into four sections: one le tter and four numbers. It usually has five characters. Let’s use the following code as an example: P 0430 . The OBD -II diagnostic trouble codes are categorized into four di fferent systems or categories. B-codes refer to the body. C-codes deal with areas outside the passenger compartment. DTC pinpoints the related  system. P-codes refer to the powertrain category, U-codes to network and vehicle integration. The second number in the DTC represents Generic and manufacturer specific codes. Generally, you will see DTCs starting with either a 0 or 1. either a generic or manufacturer specific code. 0 represents a generic code that is followed by all OBD -II vehicles. The powertrain category (P) has eight subsystems. The third character (number) in the diagnostic trouble code indicates the subsystem in which the fault is. Sometimes, you may also see a le tter (A, B, or C) instead of a number in the DTC. In that case, the three le tters refer to the hybrid propulsion systems. In our example, the third character (P0430 ) represents an issue with auxiliary emission controls. TC refer to the actual fault description. It can be  any number between  0 to 99. In our example (P 0430 ), it is 30, which indicates that the catalyst  system is below the threshold.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["excel_text = extract_data_from_excel(excel_file_name)"],"metadata":{"id":"1YA7w7ux2Ukv"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["summary_excel = generate_summary(excel_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"cFipciIs2WNz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722413896373,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":248142,"user":{"displayName":"Dhaatri Prasanna","userId":"13940518972722042632"}},"outputId":"689ee11a-e632-4488-efaf-608eed137ada"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Processing 14 chunks...\n","Processing chunk 1/14...\n","Processing chunk 2/14...\n","Processing chunk 3/14...\n","Processing chunk 4/14...\n","Processing chunk 5/14...\n","Processing chunk 6/14...\n","Processing chunk 7/14...\n","Processing chunk 8/14...\n","Processing chunk 9/14...\n","Processing chunk 10/14...\n","Processing chunk 11/14...\n","Processing chunk 12/14...\n","Processing chunk 13/14...\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Your max_length is set to 150, but your input_length is only 116.
